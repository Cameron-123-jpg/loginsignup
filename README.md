# login-signup

Fun little signup/login system I made that runs in the terminal.

**Important:** This is a proof-of-concept and **not secure**.  
Do **NOT** use this for real authentication. Passwords are stored in plaintext in `login.txt` in this repository by default â€” in production you must hash and salt passwords (e.g. use libsodium / Argon2id, bcrypt, etc.).

## Features
- Create accounts (email + password)
- Prevents duplicate emails
- Basic email validation (checks for `@`)
- Login by matching email and password against `login.txt`

## Build & run

Compile (replace `file.c` with your source file):
```bash
gcc file.c -o loginapp
