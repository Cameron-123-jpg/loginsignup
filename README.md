# loginsignup
Fun little signup/login system I made in terminal. Note, this is not safe, this is only a proof of concept. Always use hashes to store passwords, NEVER STORE IN PLAIN TEXT. Only created this to enhance my skills.

This program will create a file to store logins in the terminal, can then login using the terminal as well. Not many features. Again, this was only to test my skills. THIS IS NOT A REAL LOGIN SYSTEM
